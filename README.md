mame: h_math
description: This is a general math library/crate for Rust. When i consider this to be done i will publish it commercially on crate.io.

I strongly reccomend using h_math::prelude::*

evrything you will be calling if you use prelude will start with h_

i will only be implementing .h_average() syntax

most of what you call will only work for data types: i32, f64, [i32], [f64], Vec<i32> Vec<f64>
