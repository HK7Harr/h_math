mame: h_math
description: This is a general math library/crate for Rust. When i consider this to be done i will publish it commercially on crate.io.

I strongly reccomend using h_math::prelude::*

evrything you will be calling if you use prelude will start with h_

i will only be implementing .h_average() syntax

most
